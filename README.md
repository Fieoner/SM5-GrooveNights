# GrooveNights for StepMania 5

## Current Compatibility
This theme has been made on 5.3, and thus uses Modules, which allow for faster loading of single use scripts.
It is planned to backport the theme for 5.0.12 users, but for now, I want to focus on finishing layouts and features.

## Features
* Level System
* Judgment/Combo Sizing
* ITG Grading weights (ITG timing is not yet there)

## Considered in the future
* Implement Judgment skins (using 5.3's Appearance subdirectory)
* Implement Easter Eggs
* Add Judgment breakdown (Requested by users)
* Add MS median (Requested by users)
